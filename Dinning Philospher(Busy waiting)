 *********BUSY WAITING IN DINNIG PHILOSOPHER PROBLEM*******
This module shows how the busy waiting occurred in DINNING PHILOSOPHER PROBLEM.
Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat rice when 
he/she has both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher
can use the fork only if it's not being used by another philosopher. After he finishes eating, he needs to put 
down both forks so they become available to others. A philosopher can grab the fork on his right or the 
one on his left as they become available, but can't start eating before getting both of them.
