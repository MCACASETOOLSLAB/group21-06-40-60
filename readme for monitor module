step 1 : this is implementation of monitor module for philospher dinning problem
step 2:  as my concern for five philospher five spoons are available at initial stage
step 3:  implementation of monitor for managing these resource:
step 4:  monitor process will decide who will take the spoons first
            after selecting the option 1
step 5: 
            resource allocate 
                                     if resource is available for that philospher
            resource not allocate 
                                     if resource is not available for that philospher,then     philospher have to wait until resource is release
step 6: select option 2 for release the resource, if allocated by any other process
